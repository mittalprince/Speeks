                                <dd>â€‹Public speaking is the process of communicating information to an audience. It is
                                    usually done before a large audience,
                                    like in school, the workplace and even in our personal lives. The confidence of a
                                    person matters a lot when it comes to
                                    mass dealing, thus it is important to have faith over himself/herself as it will
                                    help them in fetching their desired
                                    goal and expressing themselves to the fullest.</dd>

                                    speaking and lack of confidence, which is
                                    a huge concern because when it comes to cooperative world, one is supposed to be
                                    expressive and confident about their
                                    opinions and thoughts. Stage fear is one of the deadliest fear among the youth, thus
